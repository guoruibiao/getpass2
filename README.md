# getpass2
A better lib compared with standard 'getpass' in Python, easier and simpler to use.

---

## How to install:


```
pip install getpass2
```

## How to use:

Make sure you are in your console.
```
from getpass2 import getpass
```

And then the function `getpass` will return what you typed and show how many characters you have typed!

## example

```
from getpass2 import getpass
...

```

If something doesn't work, you can also copy the source named getpass2.py to your workspace. That will be OK!

## Tips

You can custom your tip statement for the prompt parameter.

And most importantly, when you want to custom you tip parameter, remember to add a '%d' in it. That's really really important.

Finally, hope you can get happiness after using getpass2. Thank you!
